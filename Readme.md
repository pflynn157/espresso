## Espresso

Espresso is yet another compiler, but this is quite different from my other compilers. Rather than generating machine code, we are generating a Java class file- Java bytecode (hence the name Espresso...).

This project is proof-of-concept; as a result, it is rather incomplete. It is a good project if you're interested in using the JVM as a target, but as a useful language, it is not.

See my website for more information on the project: [https://patrickflynn.co/espresso/](https://patrickflynn.co/espresso/)
